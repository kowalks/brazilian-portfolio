# Conceptial Ideas

Operations

- There are more types of transactions

    - 


Fixed Income

    - paid at regular time intervals

## Important notes

We should have a way to distinguish a security from its realisations

For example, TESOURO PREFIXADO 2027
- Maturity date: 01/01/2027
- Face value: R$ 1000

Realizations (secondary market) on 17/02/2023
- Price: R$ 759,05
- Implied rate: 10.10% y.y.
- Days to maturity
- Implied value on some day between 17/02/23 and 01/01/27: R$ 759 < x < R$ 1000
- Has a real security (TESOURO PREFIXADO 2027) into it.
